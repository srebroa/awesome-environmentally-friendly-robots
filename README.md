# Water Waste Cleaning Robots :ocean: :blowfish:

- [WasteShark - small autonomous surface vessel (ASV)](https://www.ranmarine.io/products/wasteshark/) Designed for efficient aquatic waste management, integrating advanced sensors and technology for precise navigation and thorough cleaning. With zero greenhouse emissions and versatile, cost-effective operation, it offers an eco-friendly solution for various water bodies.
- [MR. Trash Wheel](https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/technology/) - Mr. Trash, the waterwheel that effectively removes rubbish from the river using river current to power its operation, depositing debris into a dumpster for incineration, which in turn generates power for nearby homes. In times of insufficient water current, a solar panel supplements the waterwheel's power supply, ensuring continuous operation. [MR.
