# Water Waste Cleaning Robots :ocean: :blowfish:

- [WasteShark - small autonomous surface vessel (ASV)](https://www.ranmarine.io/products/wasteshark/) Designed for efficient aquatic waste management, integrating advanced sensors and technology for precise navigation and thorough cleaning. With zero greenhouse emissions and versatile, cost-effective operation, it offers an eco-friendly solution for various water bodies.
- [MR. Trash Wheel](https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/technology/) - Mr. Trash, the waterwheel that effectively removes rubbish from the river using river current to power its operation, depositing debris into a dumpster for incineration, which in turn generates power for nearby homes. In times of insufficient water current, a solar panel supplements the waterwheel's power supply, ensuring continuous operation. [MR. Trash in action - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmpA60473Lw)
- [4ocean Mobile Skimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stZcW-b8lT0) 
The 4ocean Harbor Skimmer, equipped with two 150-gallon-per-minute pumps, collects up to 1,200 pounds of marine debris by creating a slow-suction effect on the water surface.
- [SeaClear - multi robot system for search and collect water litters](https://seaclear-project.eu/news/news/52-first-live-tests-of-seaclear-robots). The system consisting of a drone that searches for potential places to check, an underwater observation robot and a robot that collects garbage from the bottom of the water.

# Rubbish Sorting Robots :recycle:
- [ZenRobotics](https://www.terex.com/zenrobotics/4.0-efficiency-perfected) specializes in delivering a variety of automated waste sorting solutions. Known for incorporating its AI-driven robots within both established and newly developed recycling centers, the company offers a spectrum of solutions including standalone, retrofit, and greenfield systems. [ZenRobotics Fast Picker in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWmk-9pB30Y).
- [Recycleye - AI powered automatic waste sorting](https://recycleye.com/solutions/) It is two-component system featuring a computer vision technology powered by artificial intelligence for precise identification of various waste categories, coupled with a robotic arm that operates along six axes to independently select valuable materials from a recycling conveyor belt. [Recycleye in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPVSTjfcdng).
- [AMP Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMxLkXXqro) AMP Cortex is capable of recognizing more than 100 types of materials under different conditions and guides robotic arms in selecting and categorizing them. The robots deployed by AMP Cortex are standard units sourced from ABB and Omron. However, the company sets itself apart through the rapidity and precision of its software. AMP Robotics' robots pick more than 80 pieces per minute. [Kashish Rohra article about AMP Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-robotics-sustainable-blend-ai-recycling-kashish-rohra/).
- [EverestLabs](https://www.everestlabs.ai/) developed RecycleOS an AI software and robotics solution for recycling plants and materials recovery.
- [Max-AI](https://max-ai.com/) This adaptable technology seamlessly integrates into current material recovery operations to boost their sorting efficiency, without necessitating major infrastructure changes. [Max-AI in action](https://max-ai.com/video-max-ai-autonomous-qc/)
